# Radaroid — Robot Intelligence Platform

> "Le DXOMARK des Robots" — Plateforme de comparaison technique de robots humanoïdes

## About

Radaroid is the leading platform for standardized technical evaluations and job-fit scores for commercial humanoid and specialized robots. We answer the question: "Which robot is technically capable of performing my tasks?"

## Mission

Standardize the evaluation of humanoid and specialized robots through:
- Data-driven technical assessments
- Job-specific scoring algorithms
- Verified deployment tracking (OSINT)

## Key Pages

- `/robots` — Complete robot catalog with detailed technical specifications
- `/robots/[slug]` — Individual robot profiles with job-fit scores
- `/jobs` — Job-based robot rankings (waiter, warehouse picker, construction worker, etc.)
- `/jobs/[job_slug]` — Leaderboards and analysis for specific professions
- `/glossary` — Technical terms dictionary (SLAM, LiDAR, DoF, HRI, etc.)
- `/tracker` — Real-world deployment database (OSINT verified)
- `/compare` — Side-by-side robot comparison tool

## Scoring System

### Technical Potential (0-100)
Algorithm-based score comparing robot specifications against job-specific criteria:
- Numeric criteria: payload capacity, battery life, speed
- Boolean criteria: API integration, teleoperation support
- Enum criteria: navigation type, interaction level, IP rating

### Maturity Index
Status based on verified field deployments:
- 🟡 Prototype: Lab testing only
- 🟠 Pilot: Limited real-world deployments
- 🟢 Production: Multiple verified commercial deployments

## Data Structure

Each robot entry includes:
- Technical specifications (payload, speed, battery, sensors, degrees of freedom)
- Job-fit scores for 12 different professions
- Maturity status and deployment count
- Brand and manufacturer information
- Video reviews and official media

## Covered Professions

### Professional (B2B Priority)
- Warehouse Picker (warehouse-picker)
- Waiter (waiter)
- Construction Laborer (site-laborer)
- Security Patrol (security-patrol)
